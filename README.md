## About The Project

Budget Tracker is a Progressive Web Application(PWA) where a user can add expenses and funds to track with and without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, they should populate the total when brought back online. If a user(traveler) wants to track their expenses overseas without a data/internet connection, then Budget Tracker should accurately show all of their transactions.

## User Story
